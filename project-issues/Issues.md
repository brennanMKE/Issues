# Issues.app

Bugs, regressions, and feature gaps for **Issues.app** — the native macOS viewer for the IssuesSkill markdown format. Targets macOS 15+ (currently macOS 26.4). Issues here cover the SwiftUI app itself, not bugs in projects whose `issues/` folders the app is rendering.

This file is the local guide for managing issues in this project. The companion Mac app (Issues.app) watches the `issues/` folder and renders the current state. Markdown files are the source of truth — there is no JSON, generated artifact, or index to keep in sync.

## Folder layout

```
issues/
├── Issues.md          # this file
├── 0001.md            # one file per issue
├── 0001/              # optional sibling folder for screenshots, crash logs, etc.

## Status values

| File value | Display name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | Open | Filed but not yet started |
| `in-progress` | In Progress | Actively being worked on |
| `resolved` | Resolved | Work is done; awaiting user confirmation |
| `closed` | Closed | User has confirmed the fix |
| `wontfix` | Won't Fix | Acknowledged but won't be addressed |

Use the **file value** (lowercase, hyphenated) in the issue's metadata table. The Mac app converts to the display name when rendering.

## Issue file format

Each issue is `NNNN.md` (4-digit zero-padded) with this structure:

```markdown
# NNNN — Title

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | open |
| **Module** | <module name(s)> |
| **Platform** | macOS |
| **First seen** | YYYY-MM-DD |

### Format details that matter

- **Title separator** is an em-dash (U+2014, `—`), not a hyphen.
- **Metadata field rows** must keep the field name in `**bold**` exactly.
- **Dates** are `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Module** can list multiple modules separated by ` / ` (see Module conventions below).
- **Platform** is almost always `macOS` for this project. Use `All` only if it applies to the markdown format spec rather than the app.
- When status moves to `resolved` or `closed`, add a `**Closed**` row with today's date.

## Filing a new issue

1. Find the highest existing `NNNN.md` and increment. Start at `0001` if the folder is empty. Skip past reserved high numbers (e.g. `8888`, `9999` for test issues).
2. Create `issues/NNNN.md` from the template.
3. Set status to `open`.
4. Use today's date for First seen.
5. Phrase the title as a single declarative sentence describing the bug, not a question or a fix description.

## Updating an issue

Edit the file in place. The Mac app picks up changes automatically — no follow-up command. Touch only the rows or sections that changed; don't reformat the rest.

When status moves to `resolved` or `closed`, add a `**Closed**` row with the date.

## CRITICAL: do not close issues without explicit confirmation

An issue must **never** be marked `resolved`, `closed`, or `wontfix` unless the user has explicitly said so. Do not infer resolution from:

- a code change you (or a subagent) just made
- a commit message
- the filing of a related issue
- the user saying "thanks, that looks better"

When in doubt, ask. Leave status at `open` or `in-progress` until the user confirms in plain language ("close this", "this is fixed", "mark resolved", "won't fix").

A subagent that finishes implementing a fix may set status to `resolved` (the work-is-done-but-not-confirmed state). It must not set `closed` — that's the user's call.

## Attachments

Screenshots, crash logs, console output, sample data, etc. live in a sibling folder `issues/NNNN/`. Reference them with relative paths from the issue file:

```markdown
## Attachments

![Reply button does nothing when tapped](screenshot.png)
![Crash log](crash.log)
```

### macOS screenshot filename gotcha

macOS screenshot filenames use a **narrow no-break space** (U+202F) before AM/PM, visually identical to a regular space. A literal `cp` of the quoted filename will fail with "No such file or directory". Use a glob to skip past it:

```bash
mkdir -p issues/NNNN
cp ~/Desktop/Screenshot\ YYYY-MM-DD\ at\ H.MM.SS*PM.png issues/NNNN/screenshot.png
```

The `*` matches the U+202F. Substitute the actual timestamp; if you don't know which screenshot the user means, list `~/Desktop/Screenshot*` by mtime and pick the most recent.

## Visual verification

For issues involving UI changes, capture the running app window as part of the `## Verification` section. This requires the `Issues (Beta)` build to be running (bundle ID `co.sstools.Issues.beta`).

**Prerequisites:**

- `windows` CLI must be on `$PATH` — it resolves window IDs by bundle ID. Verify with `which windows`.
- Issues Beta must be running. Launch it:
  ```sh
  ./scripts/set-environment.sh Beta
  open -b co.sstools.Issues.beta
  ```
  Or build and run from Xcode using the `Issues (Beta)` scheme.

**Capture to an issue attachment folder:**

```sh
./scripts/screenshot.sh project-issues/NNNN/after.png
```

The script creates the destination folder automatically. Then embed the screenshot in the issue:

```markdown
## Attachments

![App state after fix](NNNN/after.png)
```

**Ad-hoc captures** (no destination argument) go to `screenshots/` at the repo root (gitignored):

```sh
./scripts/screenshot.sh
```

If the app is not running, the script exits with a non-zero status and a warning to stderr. Note the gap in the `## Verification` section rather than silently skipping.

## Module conventions for this project

Use one of these names (or a `A / B` pair) for the **Module** field:

- `Views` — any SwiftUI view under `Issues/Views/` (e.g. `DetailPanelView`, `SwimlaneView`, `TimelineView`, `ListView`, `RecentView`, `MainView`, `RootView`, `ToolbarView`, `HeaderView`, `StatsBarView`)
- `Services` — `Issues/Services/` (parser, folder bookmarks, file watcher glue)
- `State` — `Issues/State/` (the `IssueStore` and related observable state)
- `Models` — `Issues/Models/` (issue, status, module types)
- `Theme` — `Issues/Theme/` (colors, status palettes)
- `App` — top-level app entry, scenes, window config
- `Build` — Xcode project, schemes, package resolution
